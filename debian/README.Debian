openresolv for Debian
---------------------

pdnsd has an option selected at install time to enable various configurations.
If enabled, this silently changes the configuration file used from
/etc/pdnsd.conf
to
/usr/share/pdnsd/pdnsd-$AUTO_MODE.conf

pdnsd users are advised to follow the configuration described in
resolvconf.conf(5) and set
ATUO_MODE=
in /etc/default/pdnsd
to ensure that /etc/pdsnd.conf is used.
